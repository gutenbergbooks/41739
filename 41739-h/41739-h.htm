<h3><i>THE MIDDLE WATCH</i></h3>

<p>A farcical comedy in 3 acts. By Ian Hay and Stephen King-Hall. Produced
originally at the Times Square Theatre, New York. 9 males, 6 females.
Modern costumes and naval uniforms. 2 interior scenes.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>During a reception on board H. M. S. "Falcon," a cruiser on the
China Station, Captain Randall of the Marines has become engaged to
Fay Eaton, and in his enthusiasm induces her to stay and have
dinner in his cabin. This is met with stern disapproval by Fay's
chaperon, Charlotte Hopkinson, who insists that they leave at once.
Charlotte, however, gets shut up in the compass room, and a gay
young American widow accepts the offer to take her place, both
girls intending to go back to shore in the late evening. Of course,
things go wrong, and they have to remain aboard all night. By this
time the Captain has to be told, because his cabin contains the
only possible accommodations, and he enters into the conspiracy
without signalling the Admiral's flagship. Then the "Falcon" is
suddenly ordered to sea, and the Admiral decides to sail with her.
This also makes necessary the turning over to him of the Captain's
quarters. The presence of the ladies now becomes positively
embarrassing. The girls are bundled into one cabin just opposite
that occupied by the Admiral. The game of "general-post" with a
marine sentry in stockinged feet is very funny, and so are the
attempts to explain matters to the "Old Man" next morning. After
this everything ends both romantically and happily.</p>

<p>(Royalty, twenty-five dollars.) <span class="smcap">Price 75 Cents.</span></p></div>

<h3><i>NANCY'S PRIVATE AFFAIR</i></h3>

<p>A comedy in 3 acts. By Myron C. Fagan. Produced originally at the
Vanderbilt Theatre, New York. 4 males, 5 females., 2 interior scenes.
Modern costumes.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Nothing is really private any more&mdash;not even pajamas and bedtime
stories. No one will object to Nancy's private affair being made
public, and it would be impossible to interest the theatre public
in a more ingenious plot. Nancy is one of those smart,
sophisticated society women who wants to win back her husband from
a baby vamp. Just how this is accomplished makes for an
exceptionally pleasant evening. Laying aside her horn-rimmed
spectacles, she pretends indifference and affects a mysterious
interest in other men. Nancy baits her rival with a bogus diamond
ring, makes love to her former husband's best friend, and finally
tricks the dastardly rival into a marriage with someone else.</p>

<p>Mr. Fagan has studded his story with jokes and retorts that will
keep any audience in a constant uproar.</p>

<p>(Royalty, twenty-five dollars.) <span class="smcap">Price 75 Cents.</span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Ruin you&mdash;with such a fire in such weather! I've been trying to
warm myself by the candle for the last half hour, but not being a man
of strong imagination, failed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Hark! I think I hear some one in the office. Go&mdash;see who it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) Marley's dead&mdash;his late partner is dead as a door nail!
If he was to follow him, it wouldn't matter much.
<span class="float-right">(<i>Exit 2 <span class="smcap">e. l. h.</span></i></span>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Marley has been dead seven years, and has left me his sole
executor&mdash;his sole administrator&mdash;his sole residuary legatee&mdash;his sole
friend&mdash;his sole mourner! My poor old partner! I was sorely grieved at
his death, and shall never forget his funeral. Coming from it, I made
one of the best bargains I ever made. Ha, ha. Folks say I'm
tight-<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>fisted&mdash;that I'm a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, clutching
miser. What of that? It saves me from being annoyed by needy men and
beggars. So, this is Christmas eve&mdash;and cold, bleak, biting weather it
is, and folks are preparing to be merry. Bah! what's Christmas eve to
me? what should it be to them?</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Frank</span> and <span class="smcap">Bob, 2 e. l. h.</span></i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> There's your uncle, sir. (<i>Aside.</i>) Old covetous! He's worse than
the rain and snow. They often come down, and handsomely too, but Scrooge
never does!
<span class="float-right">(<i>Exit 2 <span class="smcap">e. l. h.</span></i></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Bah! humbug!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> Uncle, you don't mean that, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> I do. Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry? You're poor
enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> (<i>Gaily.</i>) Come, then, what right have you to be dismal! What
reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Bah! humbug!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> Don't be cross, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> What else can I be, when I live in such a world of fools as this?
Merry Christmas! Out upon Merry Christmas. What's Christmas time to you
but a time for paying bills without money&mdash;a time for finding yourself a
year older, and not an hour richer. If I could work my will, every idiot
who goes about with merry Christmas on his lips should be boiled with
his own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart&mdash;he
should!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> Uncle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Nephew, keep Christmas in your own way, and let me keep it in mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> Keep it! But you don't keep it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Let me leave it alone, then. Much good may it do you. Much good it
has ever done you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> There are many things from which I might have derived good by
which I have not profited, I dare say, Christmas among the rest, but I
am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round,
as a good time&mdash;a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only
time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women
seem by one consent to open their shut up hearts freely, and to think of
people below them as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave,
and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys, and,
therefore, uncle, though it has not put a scrap of gold or silver in my
pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and will do me good, and I
say, Heaven bless it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>Looking in.</i>) Beautiful&mdash;beautiful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Let me hear another sound from you&mdash;(<i>To <span class="smcap">Bob</span>.</i>)&mdash;And you'll keep
your Christmas by losing your situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) He growls like a bear with a sore head! (<i>Disappears.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> You're quite a powerful speaker. I wonder you don't go into
Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> Don't be angry. Come&mdash;dine with me to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> No, no&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> But why not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Why did you get married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> Because I fell in love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Because you fell in love! Bah! good evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> I want nothing&mdash;I ask nothing of you. Well, I'm sorry to find you
so resolute&mdash;we have never had any quarrel&mdash;I have made the trial in
homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last&mdash;so,
a merry Christmas, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> (<i>Aside.</i>) There's another fellow, my clerk, with fifteen shillings

retire to Bedlam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> Scrooge and Marley's&mdash;I believe I have the pleasure of addressing
Mr. Marley!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> At this festive season of the year, it is more than usually
desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and
destitute&mdash;many thousands are in want of common necessaries&mdash;hundreds of
thousands are in want of common comfort, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Are there no prisons? and the union workhouses, are they still in
operation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> They are still&mdash;I wish I could say they were not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> The treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> Both very busy, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Oh! I was afraid from what you said at first, that something had
occurred to stop them in their useful course. I'm very glad to hear it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer
of mind or body to the multitude, a few of us are endeavouring to raise
a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink, and means of warmth. We
choose this time because it is a time of all others, when want is keenly
felt and abundances rejoice. What shall we put you down for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Nothing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> You wish to be anonymous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> I wish to be left alone. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,
and I can't afford to make idle people merry&mdash;I help to support the
establishments I have named&mdash;they cost enough&mdash;those who are badly off
must go there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> Many can't go there&mdash;many would rather die!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> If they'd rather die, they'd better do it, and decrease the surplus
population. However, it's not my business, so good evening, gentlemen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> I am sorry we disturbed you. (<i>As they are about to exeunt, <span class="smcap">Bob</span>
approaches them&mdash;<span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> retires up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Beg pardon, gentlemen, I've got an odd eighteen-pence here that I
was going to buy a new pair of gloves with in honour of Christmas day,
but my heart would feel warmer though my hands were colder, if it helped
to put a dinner and a garment on a poor creature who might need. There
take it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheer.</span> Such acts as these from such men as you sooner or later, will be
well rewarded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> This way, gentlemen. I feel as light as my four-and-ninepenny
gossamer! (<i>Exeunt 2 <span class="smcap">e. l. h.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> (<i>Coming down.</i>) Give money&mdash;humbug! Who'd give me anything, I
should like to know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>Re-enter <span class="smcap">Bob, 2 e. l. h.</span></i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> A letter, sir. (<i>Gives it and retires up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> (<i>Opens it&mdash;reads.</i>) Ah! what do I see? the Mary Jane lost off the
coast of Africa. Then Frank is utterly ruined! his all was embarked on
board that vessel. Frank knows not of this&mdash;he will apply to me
doubtless&mdash;but no, no. Why should I part with my hard gained store to
assist him, his wife and children&mdash;he chooses to make a fool of himself,
and marry a smooth-faced chit, and get a family&mdash;he must bear the
consequences&mdash;I will not avert his ruin, no, not by a single penny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> (<i>Coming down.</i>) Please, sir, it's nine o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Already! You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> If quite convenient, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> It's not convenient, and it's not fair. If I was to stop
half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound, and
yet you don't think me ill used when I pay a day's wages for no work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Christmas comes but once a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> A poor excuse for picking a man's pockets every twenty-fifth of
December! Well, I suppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the
earlier next morning. Here's your week's money, fifteen shillings&mdash;I
ought to stop half-a-crown&mdash;never mind!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bob.</span> Thank you, sir! I'll be here before daylight, sir, you may depend
upon it. Good night, sir. Oh, what a glorious dinner Mrs. C. shall
provide. Good night, sir. A merry Christmas and a happy new year, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scr.</span> Bah! humbug! (<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Bob, 2 e. l. h.</span></i>) So&mdash;alone once more. It's a
rough night! I will go to bed soon&mdash;that will save supper. (<i>Takes off
his coat, boots, etc., and puts on morning gown and slippers, talking
all the time.</i>) 'Tis strange now the idea of Marley is haunting me
to-night&mdash;everywhere<span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span> I turn his face seems before me. Delusion&mdash;humbug!
I'll sit down by the fire and forget him. (<i>Takes basin of gruel from
hob.</i>) Here's my gruel! (<i>Sits in easy chair by fire&mdash;puts on night cap,
and presently appears to dose. Suddenly a clanking of chains and ringing

arises round the board, and even Tiny Tim beats the table with the

cheap as dirt. The apple sauce and mashed potatoes are delicious&mdash;and

<h3><i>THE BAT</i></h3>

<p>A mystery play in 3 acts. By Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood.
Produced originally at the Morosco Theatre, New York. 7 males, 3
females. 2 interior scenes. Modern costumes.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>Miss Cornelia Van Gorder, a maiden lady of sixty, has leased as a
restorative for frayed nerves, a Long Island country house. It had
been the property of a New York financier who had disappeared
coincidentally with the looting of his bank. His cashier, who is
secretly engaged to marry Miss Van Gorder's niece, is suspected of
the defalcation and is a fugitive. The new occupants believe the
place to be haunted. Strange sounds and manifestations first
strengthen this conviction but presently lead them to suspect that
the happenings are mysteriously connected with the bank robbery.
Any sensible woman would have moved to the nearest neighbors for
the night and returned to the city next day. But Miss Van Gorder
decided to remain and solve the mystery. She sends for detectives
and then things begin to happen. At one time or another every
member of the household is suspected of the theft. The audience is
kept running up blind alleys, falling into hidden pitfalls, and
darting around treacherous corners. A genuine thriller guaranteed
to divert any audience.</p>

<p>(Royalty, twenty-five dollars.) <span class="smcap">Price 75 Cents.</span></p></div>

<h3><i>THE HAUNTED HOUSE</i></h3>

<p>Comedy in 3 acts. By Owen Davis. Produced originally at the George M.
Cohan Theatre, New York. 8 males, 3 females. 1 interior. Modern
costumes.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>A newly married couple arrive to spend their honeymoon in a summer
cottage owned by the girl's father, who has begged them not to go
there, because he claims the house is haunted. Almost immediately
after their arrival, strange sounds are heard in the house. The
bride leaves the room for a few moments and when she returns, her
husband is talking very confidentially to a young woman, who he
claims has had trouble with her automobile down the road, and he
goes out to assist her. But when he comes back, his wife's
suspicions force him to confess that the girl is an old sweetheart
of his. The girl is subsequently reported murdered, and the bride
believes her husband has committed the crime. A neighbor, who is an
author of detective stories, attempts to solve the murder, meantime
calling in a prominent New York detective who is vacationing in the
town. As they proceed, everyone in the action becomes involved. But
the whole thing terminates in a laugh, with the most uproarious and
unexpected conclusion imaginable.</p>

<h3><i>LOUDER, PLEASE</i></h3>

<p>A comedy in 3 acts. By Norman Krasna. Produced originally at the Masque
Theatre, New York. 12 males, 3 females. 1 interior scene. Modern
costumes.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>The breathless and amusing comedy has to do with the efforts of
Criterion Pictures to keep one of its stars, Polly Madison, before
the public gaze, and Press Agent Herbert White is called in to
promote the necessary ballyhoo. He conceives the brilliant but
ancient idea of having Polly get "lost at sea" in a motor boat.
There is a law making it a punishable crime to fake a false news
report to the press, but what is a law to Herbert if he can get
over the necessary publicity? He broadcasts the news that Polly has
strangely disappeared and is lost at sea. Consequently the forces
of the law get busy, the Coast Guard sends out a fleet of airplanes
to rescue the lost film star, with the result that the front pages
of the papers are loaded with stories of the frantic search for the
actress, and the world at large is on its ear. Detective Bailey
becomes suspicious of the fake and puts the Criterion staff through
a stiff third degree. A prison cell looms up for Herbert White and
he has to resort to the most desperate measures to make the fake
story appear true.</p>

<h3><i>SKIDDING</i></h3>

<p>Comedy in 3 acts. By Aurania Rouverol. Produced originally at the Bijou
Theatre, New York. 5 males, 5 females. 1 interior. Modern costumes.</p>

<div class="small">

<p>A fresh, sincere picture of American family life, showing Marion
Hardy, a modern college girl who falls ecstatically in love with
Wayne Trenton just as a career is opening up to her, and the
difficulties she has in adjusting her romance. Then there are the
two pretty young daughters who chose to marry before they finished
their education and want to "come home to Mother" at the first sign
of trouble. Mother Hardy is so upset at the modern tendencies of
her daughters, that she goes on strike in order to straighten out
her family. Young Andy Hardy is an adorable adolescent lad with his
first "case"&mdash;a typical Booth Tarkington part. He keeps the
audience in a gale of merriment with his humorous observances.
Grandpa Hardy touches the heart with his absent-mindedness and his
reminiscences about Grandma; and the white satin slippers he makes
for Marion to be married in, have a great deal to do with
straightening out her love affair. Humor is blended with pathos and
a deliciously garnished philosophy makes "Skidding" more
significant than the average comedy. It is life. "Skidding" is one
of our most popular plays for High School production.</p>
